# PlayOps

PlayOps is a platform to manage the renting and selling of video games (digital keys or physical copies) and the retailing of hardware such as consoles, laptops, and prebuilt stations.

The project follows a principled approach, ensuring compliancy with concepts such as thinking based on classes/objects, arrays/lists, ensuring clear encapsulation and interactions between classes/objects, designing structured inheritance and interfaces, polymorphic behavior, enforcing encapsulation & access modifiers, exception handling and file persistence.
## FAQ

#### Is this a real project?

As real as you want it to be. Clearly speaking, this is a project submission for the Object Oriented Programming course at University Metropolitan Tirana.

#### Who is this useful to?

Mostly students. It is my own and my co-author's belief that dissecting code, especially code as straight-forward and principled as this project, is good practice to one's own learning and progress.

#### What is your favorite color?

Depends, I prefer dark shades of red or violet. On a good day I may even say green.
